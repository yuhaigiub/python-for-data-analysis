# python-for-data-analysis


This book is a personal remake of the book "Python for Data Analysis-Data Wrangling with Pandas, Numpy, and IPython" by Wes McKinney. 
Content in this repository is for **studying purposes** only. 
The code files have been "rewritten" with up-to-date python code, with added markdowns and comments for easy readibility.


**Note:**
- This repository doesn't contain the data to use in the code files. 
- To get the data, go to: http://github.com/wesm/pydata-book
